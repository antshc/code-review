= Tone of Voice in Code Reviews
*A simple, memorable guide for writing comments that help instead of hurt.*

Tone of voice is *how your message feels*, not just what it says.  
In code reviews, tone decides whether your comment is received as helpful guidance or personal criticism.

== Core Principles (Easy to Recall)

1. *Aim for clarity, not superiority*  
   State what you see. Avoid implying the author is wrong or careless.

2. *Target the code, never the person*  
   Prefer “this method” over “your method.” Prefer “this logic creates risk” over “you forgot…”

3. *Be specific about the outcome*  
   Offer a clear improvement or ask a focused question.

4. *Keep curiosity high and ego low*  
   Prefer “Could we simplify this by…?” over “Why would you do it like this?”

5. *Balance critique with recognition*  
   Quick positive notes make change requests easier to receive.

== Good vs Bad Tone Examples

=== Bad Tone (Personal, Vague, Accusatory)
- “You wrote this in a really confusing way.”
- “Why didn’t you use the standard API?”
- “This is wrong. Fix it.”
- “You always forget error checks.”
- “This entire PR is a mess.”

=== Good Tone (Objective, Concrete, Respectful)
- “This part is a bit hard to follow. Could we rename the variable or add a comment?”
- “Would using the standard API simplify this flow?”
- “I think this condition might miss case X — what do you think?”
- “Noticed error handling is missing here. Should we add a guard?”
- “Thanks for splitting this! One suggestion on the pagination logic…”

== Helpful Tone Templates

=== Asking a Question (Non-Blocking)
- “Question: how does this behave when the cache is empty?”
- “I might be missing something — why do we need a retry here?”

=== Making a Suggestion (Respectful)
- “Suggestion: extracting this into a helper could reduce duplication.”
- “Consider using `TryParse` to avoid exceptions here.”

=== Raising a Concern (Code-Focused)
- “The current implementation may create a race condition. Could we guard the shared state?”
- “This loop is O(n²). Is that acceptable for the expected dataset size?”

=== Acknowledging Good Work
- “Nice! This naming is super clear.”
- “Great test coverage — makes the flow easy to follow.”

== Tone Pitfalls to Avoid
- Imperatives: “Fix this”, “Rewrite this.”
- Absolutes: “Always”, “Never.”
- Sarcasm: “Interesting choice…”
- Unanchored judgment: “This is bad code.”

== One-Sentence Definition (for TWA)
*Tone of voice = communicating with clarity and respect so that feedback focuses on improving the code, not criticizing the author.*
