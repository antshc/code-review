= MMG Exchange (Meaning–Mechanism–Goal)

MMG Exchange is a framework for resolving technical disagreements by aligning three dimensions:

1. *Meaning* – what each developer believes the problem actually is  
2. *Mechanism* – how each proposed solution works technically  
3. *Goal* – what shared outcome both sides want to achieve  

When used correctly, MMG turns conflicts into clear, logical discussions.

== 1. Meaning

Developers often argue about solutions while assuming different interpretations of the same requirement.

=== Example (Banana Catalog Availability)

The system must show real-time banana availability retrieved from the external Banana Warehouse API.

Two developers interpret the issue differently:

*Developer A’s Meaning:*  
“The problem is that the warehouse API can be slow. The catalog must render immediately and must not block.”

*Developer B’s Meaning:*  
“The problem is accuracy. Every page load must show the latest availability for all bananas.”

Without clarifying meaning, both will argue about different problems.

== 2. Mechanism

After meaning is clarified, each person explains how their solution works technically.  
This shifts the discussion from opinions to factual understanding.

=== Example Mechanisms

*Developer A’s Mechanism:*  
- Render the catalog page immediately.  
- Show placeholders like _‘Loading availability…’_.  
- Trigger an async AJAX call to fetch availability for 100 bananas.  
- Update each banana status dynamically:  
  **In Stock**, **Out of Stock**, or **Availability Unknown**.

This ensures page rendering is never blocked by the warehouse system.

*Developer B’s Mechanism:*  
- Fetch all availability on the server before rendering the page.  
- Backend calls the warehouse API.  
- Returns a fully populated page with correct statuses.  
- The user sees the final availability immediately upon load.

Both mechanisms work, but they optimize different things.

== 3. Goal

Once both developers restate the shared goal, disagreements typically dissolve.

=== Shared Goal (Taken from Acceptance Criteria)

“Show accurate availability for every banana while ensuring the catalog page remains responsive even if the warehouse API is slow or fails.”

This aligns both sides:

- Developer A acknowledges accuracy is important.  
- Developer B acknowledges non-blocking behavior is required.

This often leads to a hybrid or improved solution.

== Final Summary

| Step | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| *Meaning* | Clarify what the problem actually is | “Is the issue API slowness or accuracy?” |
| *Mechanism* | Explain how each solution works | “Async AJAX vs. server-side prefetch.” |
| *Goal* | Agree on a shared outcome | “Accurate availability + non-blocking UI.” |

== Why MMG Works

- Removes hidden assumptions  
- Prevents emotional or ego-driven debates  
- Encourages objective, technical reasoning  
- Aligns everyone on outcomes, not opinions  

MMG is especially useful in design reviews, PR discussions, and architecture decision meetings.
