== Ecommerce Examples

=== question:
question: Why do we hardcode `"EU_STANDARD"` as the default shipping method?  
Will this impact US/UK customers who have different localized shipping options?

=== nit:
nit: Minor — consider renaming `CalcShipCost` to `CalculateShippingCost` for clarity.

=== suggestion:
suggestion: Instead of calling the Warehouse API for each cart item, batch product IDs into a single request to reduce checkout latency.

=== praise:
praise: Great job extracting the shipping calculator into its own service!  
This will simplify future changes to shipping rules.

== Full Example (as in a real PR)

----
praise: Love how you separated shipping logic into `ShippingCostService`.
Makes the checkout pipeline much cleaner.

question: Why do we apply free shipping only for carts above €50?
In the requirements doc it says €40 for returning customers — will that be implemented later?

nit: Optional — rename `CalcShipCost` to `CalculateShippingCost` for readability.

suggestion: The API call to get packaging dimensions is repeated several times.
Consider memoizing by product ID to avoid unnecessary network calls.
